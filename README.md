# VillagerDB - Animal Crossing Database

## Introduction
VillagerDB is our attempt to create a comprehensive, open-source
database for mainline Animal Crossing games. The scope of this
project includes Animal Forest, Animal Forest +, Animal Crossing,
Animal Forest e+, Wild World, City Folk, New Leaf, and New Horizons.
Furthermore, we aim to provide tools to the community such as
list creation and management. 

Currently, the database includes
one entity per item across all games, but in the future we may
split the data up by game in attempt to accurately portray items
and villagers from each game as accurately as possible.

## Data
All the metadata in this project is stores in JSON format,
and will always be publicly accessible. All of the JSON under
the `data/` folder is public domain.

## License
All code as part of this application is licensed under GPLv3.
